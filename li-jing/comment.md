## Executive Summary:
- original text: In recent years, the number of Internet of Things (IoT) smart devices connected to one another and systems to form various applications that make daily life more convenient and smarter has increased. However, the associated security risks, such as large-scale attacks from a large number of infected IoT devices and various variations of known IoT threats, such as zero-day attacks, are increasing in tandem with the large volume of malicious traffic worldwide. As a result, academics and industry are proposing extensive machine learning and deep learning-based data-driven security frameworks. Comprehensive datasets such as UNSW-NB15, Bot-IoT, and TON-IoT were also created as benchmark validation data to train machine learning classifiers to detect attack traffic in IoT networks. In this research, a predictive framework with multiple datasets will be developed to detect attacks represented by instances from the large-scale attack category, specifically botnet subcategories such as Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS). The research focuses on large-scale attack class detection (more efficient classification frameworks) that can be used at the edge of resource-constrained IoT systems, and appropriate performance metrics to deal with class imbalances and reduce overfitting. Appropriate data preparation with large datasets, ensemble feature selection methods combining Chi-square, Correlation Feature Selection (CFS), Gain Ratio (GR), and Minimum-Redundancy-Maximum-Relevance (MRMR) with majority voting mechanisms, SMOTE boost with traditional machine learning, and deep learning classifiers are used to classify specific large-scale attacks for the proposed framework. A variety of classifiers will be used, including Deep Neural Network (DNN) and machine learning techniques such as Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). For validation, cross-validation, time complexity analysis, and appropriate performance measures such as accuracy, precision, F1-score, sensitivity, and the AUC value of the ROC will be employed. Wilcoxon-signed testing, paired sample t-tests, and research comparisons will be used to verify statistical testing.
