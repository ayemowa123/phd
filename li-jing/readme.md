The two detectors collaborate to detect anomalous samples. The OCSVM predicts the abnormal samples initially, and after that, the GMM is applied to recheck the misclassified samples further.

**Journal paper**: [A two-stage intrusion detection method based on light gradient boosting machine and autoencoder](https://www.aimspress.com/article/doi/10.3934/mbe.2023301), by Hao Zhang et al., Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering, 2023, Volume 20, Issue 4: 6966-6992. doi: 10.3934/mbe.2023301
- Keyword: RFE, Focal loss, LightGBM, autoencoder
- Challenges: dimensionality, zero-day attack
- Idea: Two-stage detectors. This paper proposes a novel detection framework based on light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) and autoencoder.
- Methodology: The **recursive feature elimination (RFE) method** is first used for dimensionality reduction in this framework. Then a **focal loss (FL) function** is introduced into the LightGBM classifier to boost the learning of difficult samples. Finally, a two-stage prediction step with LightGBM and autoencoder is performed. In the first stage, pre-decision is conducted with LightGBM. In the second stage, a residual is used to make a secondary decision for samples with a normal class.
- Datasets: NSL-KDD and UNSWNB15
- Future work: In future work, we will mainly focus on two aspects: First, since the threshold of the autoencoder is the key factor affecting the model, we will develop a method to set the threshold automatically. Second, we segment the attack types and adopt a suitable sampling method to further improve the model performance.
