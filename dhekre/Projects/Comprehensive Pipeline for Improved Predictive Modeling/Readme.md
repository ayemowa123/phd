## In this study, 
we propose a comprehensive methodology to handle missing values, perform feature selection, and build accurate and efficient predictive models. The first step involves dealing with missing values in the dataset using the k-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) imputation technique, which searches for k data points with similar feature values and replaces the missing value with the mean or median of those neighbors. The authors then compare three popular feature selection techniques: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Decision Tree Feature Importance. These methods assess the importance of each feature based on different criteria, such as estimator performance, dimensionality reduction, and contribution to information gain.

The methodology proceeds by comparing four different classifiers, including CatBoost, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), representing a diverse range of machine learning algorithms. To address the issue of class imbalance in the dataset, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is employed, generating synthetic samples for the minority class to balance the class distribution. Lastly, the performance of the proposed methodology is assessed using a range of evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and Cohen's Kappa coefficient, providing a comprehensive understanding of the classifiers' performance. This integrated pipeline systematically addresses various challenges in data analysis and is expected to yield better predictive performance and valuable insights into the problem at hand.
